/*************************************
 * Design rules:

 - Make it readable.
 - Make it reusable.
 - Think in OOP.

 - Wrap into functions.
 - Minimize dynamic allocation.
 - Do not miss compiler warnings.

/***********************************************************************************************************************
 * Coap summarized internal function calls (for example of server):

 [loop]                         	-> everything starts. request packet buffer stays here.
    |
     - [packetRecievedBehavior]       	-> reference of the request packet(on stack, in loop) is passed.
    	|
 	 - [User defined callback]      -> the packet is passed. the callback returns char pointer of allocated string.
    	   |
 	   [sendResponse]               -> after user callback, create and send response packet, and free user string.
